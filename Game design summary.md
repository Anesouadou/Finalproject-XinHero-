# Finalproject-XinHero-

In this project we designed and implemented a game, in which a hero fights its way through enemey soldiers and genrals
The game is two-diemnsional. It is composed of two scenes and can be extended as needed.
The game was intened as a depiction of a period of chinese history (the warring state era).

However, because we couldn't find game assets of chinese  heros and soldiers. we used whatever game assets we managed to obtain.

The knight in shiny armor is the hero.
The soldier in the gray armor is an enemy.

## *Game Engine*
For the development of the game, **Stencyl** game engine was used.

This engine allows us to develop behavior and physics for each character.
It also allows us to develop the logic without having to do the detailed coding.

[Stencyl can be download from this link](http://www.stencyl.com/)

## The game was developed in three sprints

A. Sprint1
* Deciding on project that fits the scrum process
... We decided to make a game

* Selecting and learning how to use a platform that enables us to design and implement this game
... Stencyl was selected

-----------------------------------------------------------------
B. Sprint2

In this sprint:

1. [Generating the game requirements specifications by product owner]()
2. Review and analysis of these requirements by the team and coming up with clear understanding of what is expected.
3. Gathering game assets and creating an asset kit
4. depending on the game, the developers enhanced their skills required for the completion of this project
5. The Hero’s attributes are developed
* Physics
* behavior
6. The enemies’ attributes are developed 
* Physics
* behavior
7. The scene background and tile are completed
8. The scene logic is completed 

In the sprint review a number of bugs are detected, among them:
* the hero was having problem executing the attack
* There was a gap between the hero/enemy and the tile (they seemed like floating)
* The hero would disappear when jumping
* Further features and improvements are recommended
* The personality of the enemy and the hero were switched
